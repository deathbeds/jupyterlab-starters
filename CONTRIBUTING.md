## setting up

> _There are probably other ways, but I haven't tried them_

- Be on Linux/OSX
- Get [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases)
- Get [doit](https://pydoit.org)

```bash
mamba install doit
```

```bash
doit
```

Now you should have a working Lab.

```bash
doit lab
```

Try out some stuff. Make some whitepapers and cookiecutters.

## linting

```bash
doit lint
```

## testing

```bash
doit test
```

> _You may want to run against a "clean" lab, e.g. `doit`_

## hacking

```bash
doit watch:lab
```

...in another terminal

```bash
doit lab
```

## documenting

```bash
doit docs
```

...or watch for changes

```bash
doit watch:docs
```

## locking

```
mamba create -p .envs/_lock --file .github/locks/lock-linux-64-3.11.conda.lock
source .envs/_lock/bin/activate
doit lock
```

## releasing

- Download and unpack the artifacts from CI into `dist`
- Make a GitHub release with all of the release artifacts
- Upload the releases

```bash
twine upload dist/*.whl dist/*.tar.gz
npm publish dist/*.tgz
```
