## What's a starter?

A starter is a...

- single file
- directory
- python function
- [cookiecutter][]
- notebook

... that creates a...

- single file
- directory of files (or more directories)

... that shows up **where you want it** in JupyterLab **at the click of a button**

## Installing

> You'll need `jupyterlab >=2,<3`, `python >=3.6`, and `nodejs >=12`

```bash
pip install --pre jupyter_starters
jupyter labextension install @deathbeds/jupyterlab-starters
```

Check your installation:

```bash
jupyter serverextension list
```

If you don't see `jupyterlab_starters` run:

```bash
jupyter serverextension enable --sys-prefix jupyterlab_starters
```

## Configuring

Like the Jupyter Notebook server, JupyterHub and other Jupyter interactive computing
tools, `jupyter-starters` can be configured via [Python or JSON files][notebook-config]
in _well-known locations_. You can find out where to put them on your system with:

```bash
jupyter --paths
```

They will be merged from bottom to top, and the directory where you launch your
`notebook` server wins, making it easy to check in to version control.

The very simplest starter, `copy`, will copy a file or folder to the location
it is launched from in the JupyterLab [Launcher][].

```json
{
  "StarterManager": {
    "extra_starters": {
      "whitepaper-single": {
        "type": "copy",
        "label": "Whitepaper Notebook",
        "description": "A reusable notebook for proposing research",
        "src": "examples/whitepaper-single.ipynb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> more docs TBD: for now, see examples in the [demo configuration][conf].
