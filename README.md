## What's a starter?

- [x] A single file
- [x] A directory
- [x] A python function
- [x] A [cookiecutter][]
- [ ] A shell script

... that shows up in your JupyterLab at the click of a button

## Installing

> _TBD: for the time being, try a [development install][contributing]._

## Configuring

Like the Jupyter Notebook server, JupyterHub and other Jupyter interactive computing
tools, `jupyter-starters` can be configured via [Python or JSON files][notebook-config]
in _well-known locations_. You can find out where to put them on your system with:

```bash
jupyter --paths
```

They will be merged from bottom to top, and the directory where you launch your
`notebook` server wins, making it easy to check in to version control.

The very simplest starter, `copy`, will copy a file or folder to the location
it is launched from in the JupyterLab [Launcher][].

```json
{
  "StarterManager": {
    "extra_starters": {
      "whitepaper-single": {
        "type": "copy",
        "label": "Whitepaper Notebook",
        "description": "A reusable notebook for proposing research",
        "src": "examples/whitepaper-single.ipynb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> _more docs TBD: for now, see examples in [jupyter_notebook_config.json](./jupyter_notebook_config.json)_
